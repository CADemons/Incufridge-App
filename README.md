Incufridge-App
==============

Java code for the Incufridge App.

# Usage

This is the Incufridge App which allows the user to connect to the Incufridge over
the internet and run commands on it.

To run the program, download and install Java and run `./run.sh` (unix) or `.\run.batch` (windows).

This is mostly the same code as for the Incufridge-Client, but when buttons are clicked, TCP events are sent instead of serial events.
